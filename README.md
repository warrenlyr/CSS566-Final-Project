# Searching Kitty - Word Search Game

The primary objective of this project is to develop a web-based straightforward Word Search game. <u>Instead of emphasizing software development, the project seeks to provide an opportunity to experience the Agile Methodology using Scrum.</u>

In constructing the Word Search Game, we leveraged React and Node.js for the frontend client, while Flask was utilized for the backend server with RESTful API deployed for communication. All data was preserved in the MongoDB Atlas cloud.

- Guidance for setting up the local environment can be found on the [Wiki page](https://github.com/warrenlyr/CSS566-Final-Project/wiki).
